  Option 1: "Literary-Code Fusion" Theme ‚≠ê (My Top Recommendation)

  Concept: Blend your CS + English Writing background into a cohesive visual language that treats code as literature and literature as executable art.

  Visual Elements:
  - Typography Morphing: Headers that transition between code syntax (const aahad = {}) and literary prose ("Chapter One: The Developer's Journey")
  - Color Psychology: Warm parchment/paper tones (#F7F3E9) as base, with rich ink colors (#2C3E50, #8B4513) mixed with syntax highlighting accents
  - Interactive "Manuscript" Design: Sections look like illuminated manuscripts but with code annotations in the margins
  - "Compilation" Animations: Text literally compiles from prose into functional UI elements

  Why This Works: Zero portfolios do this. It's authentic to your unique background and makes you instantly memorable.

  Option 2: "Narrative Timeline Architecture"

  Concept: Structure your entire portfolio like an interactive story/book where users "read" through your professional journey.

  Visual Elements:
  - Chapter-based Navigation: "Chapter 1: Origins", "Chapter 2: The Learning Arc", "Chapter 3: Building Worlds"
  - Story Beat Progress: Instead of scroll indicators, show story progression dots
  - Character Development: Show your skills "leveling up" over time with RPG-inspired but elegant visualizations
  - Plot Twist Reveals: Projects unfold with dramatic narrative structure
